# UNLOCKING SUDOKU: AN ONLINE PUZZLE SOLVER WITH BACKTRACKING USING HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT

This project is an implementation of a Sudoku solver web application, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defines a webpage with a Sudoku grid, buttons, and metadata. CSS styles are applied to 
elements to control their layout and appearance. JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and implement Sudoku-solving logic, which involves a backtracking algorithm. The Sudoku grid is represented as a 9x9 
HTML div elements, and JavaScript functions enable filling the grid with random puzzles, solving the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm, and checking the validity of numbers placed on the board. The code 
also includes predefined Sudoku puzzles for generating random puzzles. The web application allows users to click buttons to get puzzles and solve them, with Sudoku rules applied to validate number placement. The 
backtracking algorithm is a crucial component that systematically explores possible number placements and reverts when conflicts arise, ensuring a valid solution is found.
